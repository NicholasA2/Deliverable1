Pseudocode:
Teacher degreeRate: if PhD, degreeRate = 112.
if Master, degreeRate = 82.
if Bachelor, degreeRate = 42.

ComputePayRoll(): For teachers: if full-time, salary = (32 * degreeRate *2) * 0.85.
if part-time, salary = (hoursWorked * degreeRate * 2) * 0.76.
For staff: salary = (workload * 32 * 2) * 0.75. if workload > 40, print "error".

if teacher/staff added to inexistent department, throw exception.
if teacher/staff added to department that already exists/added, throw exception
